    <h1 class="RestOftitles">A small Introduction to Mexican gastronomy and the regional gastronomy of San Luis Potosí.</h1>

    <div id="FoodServed">
        <p>
            It can be tricky to talk about the Mexican pantry served in this fair, given the profound diversity of Mexican food itself. <br>
            The foods are fiercely regional and distinct, from the fresh clams and varied seafood dishes of Baja California to the Mayan-, Dutch-, and Caribbean-influenced flavors of the Yucatán.
        </p>
        <p>
            But, keeping in mind the country's unique culinary traditions, it's fair to say that Mexican cuisine depends on three core staples: corn, beans, and chiles.<br>
            The exact types of each will vary all across Mexico, but collectively, they form a foundation that weaves its way through the kitchen, supported by a wealth of herbs,
            spices, nuts, and seeds. Together, these items reflect Mexican cooking's complex identity, which brings together a mix of preconquest foodstuffs<br>
            and items that arrived after 1521, via trade routes to Europe and Asia.
        </p>

        <p>
            Broadly speaking, we can say that a well-prepared traditional Mexican dish captures heat, salt, acidity, and smoke. <br>
            Many classic preparations call for nuts and seeds as thickeners in place of flour, and chile powders are often eschewed in favor of whole fresh or dried chiles.<br>
            Depending on the recipe, chiles are boiled, fried, toasted, roasted, or simply hydrated and blended into sauces.<br>
            And finally, because Mexico is such a fertile territory for agriculture, freshness is paramount in making good food: Herbs, fruit, chiles, and citrus dazzle <br>
            on their own, without needing much else.

            Inside the fair there is an area renowned "Muestra Gastronomica" (Gastronomic Sample), in which we can find dishes commonly served in the 52 different<br />
            municipalities of the whole state:

        <p>The gastronomy of the Huasteca region is that piece that develops the culture of said region, it carries beyond dough, chili peppers and meats, <br>
        it carries history, culture and tradition, in this way the culinary techniques that are used for the preparation and cooking of the dishes.<br>
        It is today a magnificent contribution to today's society, since it still preserves the essence and flavor that identify it as one of the richest and coarsest cuisines in the region,<br>
        with its delicious Zacahuil, its Enchiladas Huastecas and its exquisite Xojol.<br />
        In this image we can see a variety of dishes consisting of <a href="https://pinaenlacocina.com/mexican-cecinaprepared-two-ways/">"Cecina Huasteca"</a>, </p>

            The Huasteca Potosina is the proud creator of a giant tamale, it is the Zacahuil, and its size is such that it could easily feed an entire family.
            And it is that this dish is not only big in dimensions, it is also big in flavor.<br>

            It should be noted that the Zacahuil is totally different from any other tamale. One of the most relevant differences is that the potosino dish<br />
            is prepared with mashed corn, which means that the grain is ground, but small parts are left unground, which gives it a better texture.<br />
            For the filling, a sauce of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facing_heaven_pepper">Chile Chino</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascabel_chili#:~:text=Cascabel%20chili.%20The%20cascabel%20chili%20%28little%20bell%29%2C%20also,to%20rattle%20inside%20a%20dried%20cascabel%20when%20shaken.">Chile Cascabel</a> and spices is prepared and chicken, pork or turkey meat can be added;<br />
            finally the tamale is driven under the ground with firewood and hot stones. The dish brings together the best of current and traditional Huasteca food, so it is a must-see if you visit the area.

            This popular traditional breakfast dish features lightly fried corn tortillas cut into quarters and topped with green<br>
            or red salsa (the red is slightly spicier). Scrambled or fried eggs and pulled chicken are usually added on top,<br>
            as well as cheese and cream. Chilaquiles are often served with a healthy dose of frijoles (refried beans).

            According to anthropologists, this pre-Hispanic soup was once used as part of ritual sacrifices. These days <br>
            chicken, pork and vegetarian pozole versions are readily available in more everyday surroundings. Made from <br>
            hominy corn with plenty of herbs and spices, the dish is traditionally stewed for hours, often overnight.<br>
            Once it's ready to serve, lettuce, radish, onion, lime and chilli are sprinkled on top.
